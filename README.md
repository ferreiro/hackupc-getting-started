## The mindset: What do we expect from you in this hackathon?

We expect from you to have FUN, LEARN something new and to respect the rest of the hackers using our [code of conduct](). That's all, we don't have any other expectations, each of you will have different goals during the weekend, and we love that! üòç

Winning is hard, and should not be your first focus because you will put so much pressure on yourself and your team, that it's not gonna be fun! Let yourself to make mistakes, learn along the way and focus on the process rather than the pricess. This hackathon offers you an incredible opportunity: Making new friends, working with other folks that can teach you things, and build something cool you can show to your fiends or when applying to companies.

## The team: Go hunting and work with people that you can learn and have fun with!

Hacking alone is boring! In HackUPC we allow teams up to 4 people, and from our past experiences, hacking with many folks is really awesome. The most diverse and complete team, the better.

## The idea(s)

Ideally you would start finding the right idea days or weeks before starting the hackathon. While this is not required, this will help you not to waste time the first hours of the hackathon figuring out what you wanna built.

We'd suggest you to start writing down ideas using a shared docs. 

We have an amazing team building event that always takes place in the first hours of the event. We really encourage you to attend that event for many reasons:

1. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You can find those last folks to complete your superb team.
2. üí°You can get inspiration from other people's ideas.
3; üó£You can start "networking" with other hackers.

## Ideas validation

Do not keep the idea for youself! Spread the knowledge and get insights and help from mentors. Whenver you see someone with the mentors t-shirt, start talking with them! Do not be shy, they are here to help you. Ask them things like: 

## The first hours

Do not start coding right away. First think about your idea and the problem you wanna solve

## The Social Hackathon

## Presentations

Depends on the edition, there will be some rounds of judging. These rounds help us to filter all the hacks, and make a list of top final hacks that will go to the closing ceremony.

### First few rounds

In order to be successful in the first rounds, be passionate about the hack you built and follow this structure:

1) What problem you solved?
2) Demo the hack.
3) Tell them what you learned.

## Why are there sponsors and what can I learn from them?

Why are there sponsors? Sponsors allow us to make this hackathon a free event for college students. Thanks to them we can pay your travel, the yummy food, the swag, the midnight snaks... Without their money we couldn't make it possible, or we couldn't make it a free event.

What do sponsors get in return? Different sponsors have different goals: some of them are looking to find great people to do internships or to join their companies once they finish the university. Others are looking for giving back to the students community, other wanna showcase their technologies, etc... 

What can you get from the sponsors? We think that sponsors can be a good source of learning as well as getting an opportunity to have a tech internship or full time job with them. Most of the sponsors run different challenges, where they give prices. This is a really awesome opportunity to work on their tools, and
